It is a  noticeable problem that the short fibres ""dust"" out of the material,  and according to the invention this is remedied in that the material, when  made by dry forming, is provided with a surface coating of very  thin layers of pure binder fibres. In addition to a marked holding back of the  dust, these layers condition that the amount of binder fibres  in the base material can be halved and that the breaking stress of the  material is noticeably improved. Thereby the products are usable not  only as inserts, but also as individual, self-contained units e.g. for wiping  in domestic or industrial cleaning."

The prebonding may comprise calendering at 500 to 3000 lbs/linear inch using smooth rollers at 100‹C or less, preferably at room temperature, a preliminary application of part of the binder by spraying or by spraying with binder followed by calendering. A 2 to 20% by wt. aqueous solution of starch, animal glue or carboxymethyl cellulose is applied to the prebonded web by passing it down through the nip formed by the two rolls of a size press as binder solution is fed to the nip. In one embodiment a starch size is combined with the starch binder. The web takes up approximately its own weight of binder solution. The fibres may be chemically liberated wood fibres, groundwood and bleached softwood kraft fibres being exemplified. Before prebonding the web may have a moisture content of 4 to 25% by weight."

As shown the web is formed from three corded layers of fibres of length  inch to 3 inch, selected from cotton, rayon, polyolefin, polyester, cellulose acetate, acrylic or polyamide. Garnetts may replace the cording machines 10. Alternatively wood pulp or cotton linter fibre of less than  inch length may be air laid, optionally mixed with textile length fibres.  The temporary binder is preferably starch. Alternatively dextrin, animal glue, gum, casein, carboxymethyl cellulose, urea-formaldehyde resin, polyacrylate, polyamide, polyvinyl alcohol or a polyvinyl alcohol/polyvinyl acetate copolymer may be used. It may be sprayed, padded or coated onto one or both web surfaces, or mixed in powder form with the fibresduring web formation and activated with moisture. As shown an aqueous dispersion of starch is applied by lower roll 22 of a bonding nip and the water is removed by dryer cans 32.  The permanent binder is an emulsion or dispersion of polymers or copolymers of ethylene, vinyl acetate, acrylate, styrene, butadiene, vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride. A latex dispersion of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer is preferred. It is applied by gravure roll 38. Creping drum 48 rotates at a circumferential speed of 105 to 150% of the take-up roll. Both sides of the web can be printed with permanent binder and then creped. The web is heated by cans 56 to remove moisture and cure the binder if a curable binder is used."

The sheet may be formed using a dry or wet forming process. Typically, polypropylene fibres may be dispersed together with a binder (e.g. polyethylene oxide or a saponified compound of a vinyl acetate polymer or copolymer, or acetal thereof), in water, the dispersion wetlaid to form a sheet, the sheet heated to cause shrinkage, and the binder washed from the sheet. The binder may be added in the form of a powder or fibres. Alternatively, the fibres may be dispersed in an organic solvent to form a dispersion, which is wet-laid to form a sheet, the sheet being heated to cause the fibres to partially dissolve in residual solvent and to fuse them together. Sheets, thus obtained, after drying may be frictionally calendered by passage between a pair of rolls each of which rotates at a speed different from the other. Conventional calender rolls composed of an elastic roll e.g. paper or rubber roll and a steel roll may be used. Polyethylene fibres having a density of from 0.955 to 0.97 g/cm3 or polypropylene microfibres of 2-10Á average fibre diameter and having an extractable content in decalin at 77‹C of less than 15% by wt. may be incorporated in the sheet of polypropylene fibres. Alternatively the polyethylene fibres may be incorporated in the form of bicomponent fibres with the polypropylene fibres. The sheet may be washed with an appropriate solvent before and/or after frictional calendering. Examples 1, 2, and 4 describe the formation of fibrous polypropylene sheet material using dry forming methods involving needling. The other Examples describe the use of wet-formation techniques, some of which involve the use of carboxymethyl cellulose and fibrous polyvinyl alcohol as binders together with surfactants."
