CONSTITUTION: A fiber-loosened article 1 and crushed article 2 of waste paper are put and blended in a mixer by a specified ratio, and agitated while a sizing material 3, which is a water-dispersed liquid of starch is being sprayed at the mixture, and a mixture 4 under a condition wherein the starch water dispersed liquid is uniformly dispersed and stuck is formed. After charging the mixture 4 in a mold with a gate, the gate is closed to close the mold. Then, steam is made to pass through the mixture in the mold through holes. By this process, the gelatinization of the starch water dispersed liquid is generated. Then, the hole is opened and a evacuation is done to accelerate drying. Then, the mold is opened, and a molding is taken out, and the molding is completed by completing the drying by leaving it to stand, or jetting hot air when necessary.COPYRIGHT: (C)1996,JPO"
